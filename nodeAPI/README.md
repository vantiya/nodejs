## Create an Endpoints and test it them from postman.

I have created this small demo project that demonstate how to create a sample API endpoints and can access through postman.

Initially, I have used JSON data from json file and implement CRUD operation - Update and Delete was not implemented in actual.

Gradually I learned how to destructure the code so project can use MVC architechture.
